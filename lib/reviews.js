      "We asked CHS to upgrade our house when we moved in.  They came and assessed what we currently had and recommended what we'd need based on what we outlined.  They not only delivered a professional service, but they went above and beyond what we expected in terms of delivering a solution, providing support, and left us with a great experience from start to finish. Every aspect was considered and delivered with minimal disruption, it's made the world of difference to our home.",

      'This is a very good company. They work with you to get the best systems. The work is very tidy and they demonstrate the simplest of things to people. Once the work has been completed you are not forgotten about. The aftercare, in my opinion, is amazing. Emails are responded to quickly and they pop in if needed. I only wish I had used this company from the start.',
